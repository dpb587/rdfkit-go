	// “minValue”: 2500, “maxValue”: 7500, "unitCode": "USD" } <p>[[QuantitivateValue]] can also be used for percentage

	// doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#). The motivating
	// scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus
	// pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is
	// oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as
	// feedback emerges from use. In addition to our usual [Github
	// entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this
	// document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#). While this schema
	// is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology
	// like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is
	// to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency
	// situation. Several kinds of information can be provided: We encourage the provision of "name", "text",
	// "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and "url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a
	// value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of
	// the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be
	// "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\_coronavirus\_pandemic" or
	// "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910". For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links
	// or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the
	// appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url
	// as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page. It is unlikely that a single
	// SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously. We expect that in many cases the page
	// referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]],
	// [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the
	// events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the
	// [[SpecialAnnouncement]]. Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local
	// organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific
	// [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific
	// location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and
	// [[announcementLocation]]. The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the
	// announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a
	// [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup
	// should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too. The basic content of
	// [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or
	// [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like
	// information can be shared by posting [[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with
	// Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an
	// inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing media type information, e.g. "application/rss+xml" or
	// "application/atom+xml".

	// A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The

	// [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative
